    "Start with the smallest prime factor, $2$, and divide the number by it until it is no longer divisible. Then move on to the next candidate factor, $3$, and repeat. Continue until the number is $1$. Note that if a candidate is a factor, it must be prime, since any composite factor would have smaller prime factors that would have already been found.\n",
